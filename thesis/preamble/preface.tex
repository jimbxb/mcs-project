\Preface{
  This thesis focuses on an established language, Wybe, that existed before the commencement of this piece of work. All code written by myself in support of this piece of work was independently reviewed by my supervisor, \supname. Feedback received was then further incorporated into the code. Any previously existing code is documented as being such throughout this document. Feedback was also received from my supervisor throughout the creation of this thesis and was incorporated into the final product.

  The literature review portion of this thesis is taken from, and further modified from, the research proposal that was undertaken to fulfill another portion of the requirements of the \degreename. This literature review was ultimately inspired by the work of myself in the completion of COMP90044 (Research Methods), prior.
