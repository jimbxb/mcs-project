Higher-order programming allows for a greater level of abstraction over first-order programming. Allowing for procedures to be passed into or out of a procedure is the hallmark of this programming style. An emerging programming language, Wybe, currently does not support higher order programming, nor does the intermediate representation used internally by the Wybe compiler, logic programming virtual machine (LPVM). In this research, we propose an extension to LPVM, and further to Wybe, to support higher order programming. Wybe presents novel language features, which together with higher order programming, provide a novel language implementation space.
